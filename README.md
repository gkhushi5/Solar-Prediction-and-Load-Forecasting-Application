1. Developed real-time economic load dispatch algorithms for optimal power generation
scheduling based on fluctuating demand and generation costs.

2. Integrated demand response programs to incentivize consumers, reducing peak demand and 
enhancing grid stability without frequent load shedding.

3. Optimized microgrid operations with renewable sources, energy storage, and load balancing 
strategies for efficient islanded and grid-connected microgrids.

4. Enabled energy market participation with optimized bidding strategies for day-ahead, real-time, and ancillary services markets.
   
5. Optimized energy storage integration with scheduling algorithms for grid support services 
and energy arbitrage.

6. Designed innovative market mechanisms like peer-to-peer trading for efficient energy 
exchange and renewable integration.
